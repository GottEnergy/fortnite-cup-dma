offsets are up to date. just update them in offsets.h
in case the cr3 fix get patched some day you have to figure it out by yourself.
esp works nearly flawless (value cache is implemented)
aimbot is kind of good for now. maybe implement a better vis check and an actual nearest hitbox selection. As of now it will be static and random.
Cheat is based on:
https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/fortnite/677028-fortnite-dma-cheat-cr3-shuffling-fixed.html

updated the most part of the aimbot and visual aspect of the cheat.
